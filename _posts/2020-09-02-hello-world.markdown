It's been forever since I have committed my thoughts to writing, so please forgive me if my writing appears as stream of consciousness. This will be a personal journal in which I will write what is on my mind, what is troubling me, my highs, my lows, and my aspirations. The aim of my writing is as a form of therapy. As such, my target audience is myself, but I welcome all readers.
