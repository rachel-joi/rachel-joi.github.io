Well, it finally happened. I have restarted HRT. I should be celebrating this moment, and in a way I am. My mood is better, and I have this untangible sense that I am back on the right track.

But restarting HRT is a failure in the goals I set myself, and to my relationship with my significant other. Stopping HRT - and not transitioning - was a prerequisite to remaining in a relationship with her. I love her so much, but coming to terms with my gender identity has put such a wedge in our relationship. I stopped HRT and put aside any hope of transitioning to continue being with her, but I failed her. I should be an emotional wreck right now, but my mind feels oddly at ease. I was out of sorts when I was enjoying myself, being happy with her. I was miserable when transition was not a goal. It was always my choice, and I have made it.
